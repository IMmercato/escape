# Escape

A mysterious message has appeared on your terminal. Your mission is to compile the source code, run the program, and uncover the truth.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8** or higher installed on your system.

* To check your version, run: `java -version`

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to initialize the sequence:

1. **Navigate to the Project**
Open your terminal and move into the source directory:
```bash
cd escape

```


2. **Compile the Source**
Transform the Java file into executable bytecode:
```bash
javac escape.java

```


3. **Execute the Program**
Run the application to reveal what’s hidden:
```bash
java escape

```

### Troubleshooting

* **"javac is not recognized":** Ensure your JDK `bin` folder is added to your system's PATH environment variable.
* **Case Sensitivity:** Remember that Java is case-sensitive. Ensure the filename matches `escape.java` exactly.
